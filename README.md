No clue for a project idea. Came up with the most mediocre thing possible. A blogging web application. Maybe good features won't make it so mediocre. I started this to learn the MERN technology stack. I'll be following [this guide from MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorialhttps:/) to learn the technology stack.

## What is MERN?
>The MERN stack is a web development framework made up of the stack of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Nodejs. It is one of the several variants of the [Mean Stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mean-stack).

> When you use the MERN stack, you work with React to implement the presentation layer, Express and Node to make up the middle or application layer, and MongoDB to create the database layer.
